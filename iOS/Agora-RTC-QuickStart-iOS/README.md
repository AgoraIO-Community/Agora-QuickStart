# Agora-RTC-QuickStart

This example demonstrates how to integrate the Agora Real-Time Communication SDK to build a simple real-time interactive app from scratch with minimal code. It is suitable for interactive live streaming and video call scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing the functionality, please prepare the development environment as follows:

- Xcode version 14 or above.
- iOS SDK level 13 or above.
- Two mobile devices running iOS 13.0 or above.
- A computer with internet access. If your network environment has a firewall, refer to [Handling Firewall Restrictions](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/core-functionality/cloud-proxy?platform=ios) to use Agora services normally.
- A valid Agora account and project. Refer to [Enable Service](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/get-started/manage-agora-account?platform=ios) to obtain the following information from the Agora Console:
  - App ID: A string randomly generated by Agora to identify your project.
  - Temporary Token: Also known as a dynamic key, used for user authentication when the client joins a channel. The temporary token is valid for 24 hours.

## Running the Example Program

This section explains how to compile and run the example program.

1. Go to the [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io/v2), copy the **App ID** from your project, and note it down for later use when starting the application.
2. (Optional) If you have enabled the security mode, use the [Temporary Token Generator](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/get-started/manage-agora-account?platform=android#generate-temporary-tokens) to generate a temporary token for the RTC product of a channel. Copy the **Channel Name** and **Token** and note them down for later use when starting the application.
3. Edit `Agora-RTC-QuickStart/iOS/Agora-RTC-QuickStart/Agora-RTC-QuickStart/ViewController.Swift`, and replace `<#Your App ID#>`, `<#Your channel name#>`, and `<#Your Token#>` with your App ID, Channel Name, and Token respectively.

```
// Fill in your project's App ID, which can be generated in the Agora Console
private let appId: String = "<#Your App ID#>";
// Fill in the channel name
private let channelName: String = "<#Your channel name#>";
// Fill in the temporary token generated in the Agora Console
private let token: String = "<#Your Token#>";
```
4. Use the pod install command. 
5. Open Agora-RTC-QuickStart-iOS.xcworkspace with Xcode, then you can compile and run the project
